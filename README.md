# Linear_Regression

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains two small projects that demonstrate the use of *Linear Regression* in solving real-world prediction problems:
1. *House Price Prediction* – Predicting property prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and construction year.
2. *Canada Per Capita Income Prediction* – Forecasting Canada's per capita income using historical GDP per capita data.

## 📖 About Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a *supervised learning algorithm* used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables.  
It works by fitting a straight line (in simple regression) or a hyperplane (in multiple regression) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.  
The equation for a simple linear regression is:

\[
y = mX + c
\]
Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted output  
- \( X \) is the input feature  
- \( m \) is the slope (coefficient)  
- \( c \) is the intercept
